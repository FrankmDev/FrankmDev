# ¡Hola! Soy Frank Dev ⚡️

### Frontend Developer
####  I am a passionate self-taught web developer looking for my first job opportunity in the IT sector. Currently, I am advancing my education by pursuing the Higher Degree in Web Application Development (DAW) and have accumulated valuable experience through various certificate courses and personal projects.

In addition to my training, I have spent 3 years teaching private classes in science, mathematics, physics, chemistry and technical drawing, which has improved my communication skills and patience.

While I have not had the opportunity to apply my experience in the IT sector professionally, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge in a work environment. My determination, creativity and commitment are assets that motivate me to face new challenges and continually learn.
